Screeps.com is a game about writing AI.
Your goal in Screeps is to write an AI that can do everything you usually do yourself in an Real-Time Strategy game.
Gather resources, grow your economy, expand, take territory, defend itself from attacks, and wage war on other players (both human and AI).
AIs for this game are written in JavaScript, and this repro reflects my work creating one.

I started a couple of days ago (as I write this). 
So, my AI is currently designed to manage my units, accomplish the goals I set for it, and defend itself. Just the basics.

In future, I'd like to try having it set its own goals. Where to expand. Which resources to take. That sort of stuff.
Perhaps include some learning element to it - so it can try different things, measure the results, then make decisions based on the results.
